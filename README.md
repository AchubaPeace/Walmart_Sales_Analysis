From the data,  measures need to be put in place, monitored or maintained to accomodate for staffing and scheduling at peak periods between afternoon and evening. inventory and store offers can be managed to meet the needs of customer segments (members and female)that bring in the most revenue. for instance Fashion accessories has a higher sales count than food & beverages but brings in lesser revenue and gross profit in comparison. on the flip slide, inventory and offers to improve patronage or target other customer segments. The data shows revenue by city and branch , resources can be allocated to branches that are falling behind better performing branches. The data shows members spent more than non members, membership should be encouraged across all cities and branches.

Ideally Gross revenue/profit for a healthy  business should be between 20%- 40% of the revenue but the gross revenue for individual product lines and commulatively barely scratch the 10% mark, strategies to reduce the COGS(cost of goods sold) or source more profitable products and brands or increase the turnover rate on each product line should be seriously considered.
